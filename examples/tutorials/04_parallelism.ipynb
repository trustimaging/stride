    "In practice, derivatives of the optimisation problem are not calculated one data point at a time, but in batches, and the result is averaged to obtain an estimate of the gradient for that iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because, in most cases, each of these data points is fully independent, this can be exploited so that they are calculated in parallel. For some simple problems, this can be done within a single workstation. However, in most practical problems, the compute and memory demands require that these computations are mapped across different interconnected sets of hardware, such as multi-GPU systems, CPU clusters, or the cloud.\n",
