class ProblemTypeBase(ABC):
    """
    Problem types encode the physics of the forward and inverse problems that we want
    to solve using Stride. In most cases, these physics will correspond to state and adjoint PDEs
    describing problems of interest.

    A problem type could have multiple implementations, depending on how the physics are solved
    or the techniques that are used to solve them.

    For example, the ``acoustic`` problem corresponds to the second-order isotropic acoustic
    wave equation, which currently has one implementation using the Devito library. This implementation
    is contained within the ``acoustic/devito`` folder.

    Problem types inherit from this base class, and have to comply with a certain interface by
    defining, at least, a series of methods.

    To solve the state or forward problem:

    - ``before_state``
    - ``state``
    - ``after_state``

    and to solve the adjoint problem:

    - ``before_adjoint``
    - ``adjoint``
    - ``after_adjoint``

    If the problem type has to provide the gradient for a certain optimisation variable, the
    class will also have to define a pair of methods per variable:

    - ``set_grad_[variable_name]`` will be called before the adjoint run to prepare the calculation of the gradient.
    - ``get_grad_[variable_name]`` will be called after the adjoint run to fill in the calculated gradients.

    in order for the gradients to be calculated.
