    The Problem is the object that fully defines the setting in which Stride works.

    The problem defines a medium with a set of fields (such as Vp or density), some
    transducers (such as a series of scalar point transducers), a geometry where those
    transducers are located in space, and the acquisitions that happen given that geometry.

    The problem also defines a problem type, which determines the physics of interest, such
    as the second-order isotropic acoustic wave equation. And a numerical implementation
    of those physics, such as through the finite-difference library Devito.
